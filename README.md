This API testing framework, developed as a mini-project for practicing API testing in Java, provides a comprehensive suite of features to automate API testing, improve test coverage, and ensure the reliability and quality of APIs.

API testing is an integral part of software development and testing, ensuring that APIs function as intended and meet business requirements. This framework encompasses a robust set of features to streamline the API testing process, encompassing core functionalities, application-specific modules, and test execution capabilities.

This framework has 7 layers
 * Endpoints class:Centralizes and manages endpoint URLs and configurations for API interactions.
 * Payloads(Pojo):Defines and structures payload objects to ensure consistency and readability.
 * Utities: Houses reusable functions and helper methods to simplify common testing tasks.
 * Test data(Data driven testing):Facilitates data-driven testing, allowing tests to be executed with different data sets.
 * Test case Classes: Houses test cases that validate various API functionalities and edge cases.
 * Execution: Executes configured TestNG XML files via Maven command-line for automated testing.
 * Reports(Extent): Generates comprehensive test reports for easy analysis and identification of issues.
